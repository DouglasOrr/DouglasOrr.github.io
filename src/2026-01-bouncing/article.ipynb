    "\n",
    "Collision detection between balls (circles) is straight-forward. Calculate the straight-line distance between the two balls, and if it's less than the sum of radii, they overlap & have collided. But how to handle the collision?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we should do is to update the velocity of the two colliding balls. From one ball's perspective, look at the approach velocity of the other ball, then add this approach velocity to ours. Since both balls do the same (implicitly in the opposite direction), momentum is conserved. Note that this assumes they have the same mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details markdown=\"1\"><summary>Conserving energy</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule also conserves energy. It wasn't immediately obvious to me why this is. Kinetic energy is proportional to the speed squared. Now think of the velocity of balls 1 and 2 in two components: $a_1$ and $a_2$ in the approach direction of the other ball and $p_1$ and $p_2$ perpendicular to that. The \"add the approach velocity\" rule means the new velocity of ball 1 is $a_1 + (a_2 - a_1) = a_2$, and vice versa for ball 2. So, the balls swap their velocity components in the approach direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of their speeds squared is equal to $a_1^2 + p_1^2 + a_2^2 + p_2^2$ by Pythagoras, so it doesn't matter if they swap $a$-components, the kinetic energy is preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we leave it at this, we hit an issue: the balls stick together when they collide (see below, left). The problem is that we haven't detected the collision early enough --- the balls already overlap, and updating the velocity might not be enough to fix it before the next frame, which will make the collision logic fire again, cancelling itself out!\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution is to immediately move the colliding balls so they don't overlap any more. On the next frame, since they're now moving away from each other, they won't get stuck. This works OK, if a bit \"jumpy\", and if you overcrowd the balls so there isn't enough space, it (understandably) goes a bit crazy. I also don't like the fact that this might move the ball to make it overlap with another one that you've already have tested for collisions with on this frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more elegant solution is to leave the balls overlapping, and update the condition for collision: you are only colliding if you overlap AND you're moving towards each other. This rule isn't perfect, but seems to do a reasonable job in practice.\n",

    "\n",
    "My initial implementation started was getting pretty slow with around 2000 balls, updating at 200 physics ticks per second. My browser dev tools illustrated the limiting factor: exhaustive checking for collisions on every frame. The collision checking implementation looked like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ts\n",
    "this.foreach((i) => {\n",
    "  this.foreach((j) => {\n",
    "    if (i >= j) return;\n",
    "    const dx = this.px[j] - this.px[i];\n",
    "    const dy = this.py[j] - this.py[i];\n",
    "    const rsum = this.r[i] + this.r[j];\n",
    "    const distSq = dx * dx + dy * dy;\n",
    "    if (distSq < rsum * rsum) {  // if overlapping\n",
    "        ...                      // handle collision\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code exhaustively checks all pairs of balls, so for 2000 balls at 200 ticks/s, it's gunning for (1/2) $\\times$ 2000 $\\times$ 2000 $\\times$ 200 = 400 million collision tests per second. Too many.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fix I went with is spatial hashing. The idea is still to test one-by-one, but to quickly rule out most of the balls that are nowhere near the one being tested. So we divide the screen up into buckets (I went with 50 x 50 = 2500 total), and put balls into any buckets that their bounding box overlaps. Now we can quickly find all balls that might collide in a given portion of the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have this, go through each bucket and run the same exhaustive algorithm above within the bucket. There will be far fewer balls to compare, so this stage will run much faster. With this, I could simulate 10$\\times$ as many balls on my laptop, about 20,000. (I presume you could apply this recursively to go further --- I guess that's the [BSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning)/[quadtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) idea.)"

(The only important one that I didn't explain already is the \"bounce factor\", or coefficient of restitution, which absorbs or adds energy when balls hit each other, or the walls.) Even with such a simple simulation, we can get some interesting and beautiful emergent behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "My favourite is to shrink the size of the balls, reduce the bounce on collision so that balls lose energy when they collide with each other, and increase the bounce on the top and/or bottom walls to add energy to compensate. You get a sort of \"cooling\" crystal structure of balls away from the walls, but the balls near the walls have more energy and help to jiggle the system into more stable shapes.\n",
